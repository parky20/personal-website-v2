                My name is Yuni Park, and I recently graduated from <HighlightedText>
                Khoury College of Computer Science at Northeastern University </HighlightedText> with a degree in <HighlightedText>Computer Science and Cognitive Psychology</HighlightedText>.
                Growing up, I always enjoyed art, solving problems, and helping others through creative ways. <br/> <br/> 
                At Northeastern, I had the opportunity to delve deeper into human behavior and the technical side of computing. 
                Combining my interdisciplinary skills, I aim to <HighlightedText>develop solutions</HighlightedText> that solve real-world problems, and bring enjoyment to people’s lives by providing an inclusive user experience. <br/><br/>
                In my free time, you’ll often find me spending time with friends and family, travelling, learning new baking recipes and exploring the city!</p>
